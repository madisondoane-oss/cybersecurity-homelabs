# cybersecurity-homelabs
Documentation, discussion, and reflection of any labs relating to cybersecurity / computer science that I have completed or plan to do in the future.

**About this repository**

This repository serves as my hands-on cybersecurity training environment where I sumulate real enterprise scenarios in a controlled lab.
Rather than only studying concepts, I build networks, intentionally break them, analyze behavior, and document troubleshooting and detection processes.

My Goal is to prepare for an entry-level SOC Analyst / Security Analyst role by develping practical skills in:
  1. Network troubleshooting
  2. Host discovery na enumeration
  3. Vulnerability analysis
  4. Log investigation and detection
